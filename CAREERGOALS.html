                    I am a Computer Science student. I will be graduating as a "Computer Scientist" in year 2021 InShaAllah.My career goal and objectives are simple as well as intereting. I wanted to be more towards website designing sites and graphic designing in my future because I have always been good at designing stuffs and designing websites using any source has always fascinates me.One of the most easiest and simplest way to design webpages is, I guess "html+css+java" scripting but we should not alwaysjuat tuck to one thing and always try to explore new materials for your better knowledge.I think in my opinion the best source for making websites of any kind is "WORD PRESS".It gives you plenty of options to design any website in multiple ways and I beleive, it is one of the most easiet way to be a good web-designers and to earn good amount of money from this online platform.

                    It's useful to develop a personal portfolio of your own projects, such as those involving programming, building a website or carrying out tasks online as a moderator. Evidence of, for example, your initiative and ability in fixing bugs, improving functionality or building an app will help show your skills and interest. And I think I would love to learn MACHINE LEARNING and DIGITAL MARKETING in my upcoming future :')
